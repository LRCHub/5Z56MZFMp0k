Incubation of a mental disease
Transpiration of a spiteful liquid
Coming to terms with the Devil
Threatening like the reaper in a saddle

You sow the seeds of discord
You'll reap the fruits of death
You sow the seeds of discord
You'll reap the fruits of death

He learned to dominate the gamesmanship of war
An outrage, cynic for us all
You are a rusty nail in our coffin
The world's reminding exhibition

You sow the seeds of discord
You'll reap the fruits of death
You sow the seeds of discord
You'll reap the fruits of death

You sow the seeds of discord
You'll reap the fruits of death
You sow the seeds of discord
You'll reap the fruits of death

One man's meat is another one's poison
So kill yourself with tears of joy
We'll never accept to bite the dust like this
Got a mighty weapon to defend us

You sow the seeds of discord
You sow the seeds of discord
You sow the seeds of discord
You sow the seeds of discord
