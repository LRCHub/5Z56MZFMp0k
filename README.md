[00:09.09] I'm not a fan of puppeteers, but I've a nagging fear
[00:11.89] Someone else is pulling at the strings
[00:13.66] Something terrible is going down through the entire town
[00:16.46] Wreaking anarchy, and all it brings
[00:18.23] I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
[00:22.24] I curse the name, the one behind it all
[00:41.74] 
[00:27.24] Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
[00:29.32] And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[00:31.67] Discord, whatever did we do
[00:33.88] To make you take our world away?
[00:36.30] Discord, are we your prey alone
[00:38.44] Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
[00:40.80] Discord, we won't take it anymore
[00:42.97] So take your tyranny away
[00:55.47] 
[01:03.66] I'm fine with changing status quo, but not in letting go
[01:06.77] Now the world is being torn apart
[01:08.37] A terrible catastrophe played by your symphony
[01:11.23] What a terrifying work of art
[01:13.10] I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
[01:17.03] I curse the name, the one behind it all
[01:36.53] 
[01:22.30] Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
[01:24.12] And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[01:26.53] Discord, whatever did we do
[01:28.84] To make you take our world away?
[01:31.24] Discord, are we your prey alone?
[01:33.41] Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
[01:35.86] Discord, we won't take it anymore
[01:38.08] So take your tyranny away
[01:50.58] 
[02:53.56] Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
[02:55.69] And sleepin' in the middle of a summer afternoon
[02:58.07] Discord, whatever did we do
[03:00.15] To make you take our world away?
[03:02.68] Discord, are we your prey alone
[03:04.84] Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
[03:07.12] Discord, we won't take it anymore
[03:09.32] So take your tyranny away
